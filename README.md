# Portfolio

Updated August 4th 2019

This is my work portfolio to display the web applications I made. I switched over to a free Bootstrap template that keeps all components on one page rather than three separate pages (About, Portfolio and Contacts) generated during the first week of coding bootcamp. 
The grayscale, minimalistic aesthetic appeals to me because I believe that simple frameworks highlight the content best.
